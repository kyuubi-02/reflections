1.) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-->empty .git folder is created. it is required to save previous commits.

2.)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is intermediate between working directory and repository. It contains files from working directory that have to be added to repository. It is just a logical concept whereas working directory and repository are actual locations.
